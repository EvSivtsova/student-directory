The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

#### Makers's precourse:

The goal of this tutorial is not only to show you the process of creating a project from scratch.

The script is invoked from the command-line and there are no external libraries to use. It has text-based interface that will not look particularly exciting but it's really important to understand how to build basic things before trying to create sophisticated websites.

#### How to use

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
